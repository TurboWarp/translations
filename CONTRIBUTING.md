## Joining the translation team

### Requirements

 - You must have a GitHub account. This also means you must be at least 13 years old.
 - You must be fluent in both English and another language (or even multiple languages).
 - Each language must already be [part of Scratch](languages.md).
 - This isn't expected to be a large time commitment. The initial translation for new languages might take ~20 minutes. The recurring time commitment shouldn't more than a few minutes per week.

### Request to join

 - Make a [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/signup/) account. The name you enter will be public, so don't enter your real name if you don't want that. You can sign in with your GitHub account if you'd like. Choose "Join an existing project" when prompted.
 - Create an issue using this template: https://github.com/TurboWarp/translations/issues/new?labels=request+to+join&template=join-translation-team.md
 - Subscribe to this GitHub issue for updates: https://github.com/TurboWarp/translations/issues/27
 - It may take a few days for requests to be reviewed.
