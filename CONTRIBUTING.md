## Joining the translation team

### Requirements

 - You must have a GitHub account. Note that the GitHub ToS says you must be 13 years old.
 - You must be fluent in both English and another language (or even multiple languages).
 - Each language must already be [part of Scratch](https://github.com/TurboWarp/translations/blob/master/languages.md#readme).
 - The initial translation for new languages might take ~30 minutes. Please check occasionally (once a week is enough) to translate any newly added strings. This isn't expected to be a large time commitment. Don't lose sleep over this.

### Request to join

 - Make a [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/signup/) account. You can use your GitHub account if you'd like.
   - You must make your account public. Don't enter your real name if you don't want it to be public.
   - When it asks about department, you can use "Localization" and "Individual contributor"
   - Choose "Join an existing project"
   - Do not send a request to join through Transifex -- follow the steps below.
 - Create an issue using this template: https://github.com/TurboWarp/translations/issues/new?labels=request+to+join&template=join-translation-team.md
 - It may take a few days for requests to be reviewed.
 - Wait for request to be accepted before continuing.

### Writing translations

When your request is accepted, you will get an invitation from Transifex to join the translation team. Accept it. You're now ready to start translating.

Find your language on https://www.transifex.com/turbowarp/turbowarp/dashboard/ and click the Translate button.

Read https://docs.transifex.com/translation/translating-with-the-web-editor to learn how to use the Transifex translator. It's a lot simpler than it looks.

Translations will be occasionally pulled from Transifex. You don't have to do anything additional, it just might take a few days.
