## Joining the translation team

### Requirements

 - You must be fluent in both English and another language.
 - We want translations written by humans, not by machines.
 - Each language must already be part of Scratch.
 - The initial translation for new languages should take under an hour. Please check occasionally to translate any newly added strings. This isn't expected to be a large time commitment. Don't lose sleep over this. We're all unpaid volunteers.

### Request to join
 
 - Go to [our Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/turbowarp/turbowarp/), and click on the blue "Help Translate TurboWarp" button.
 - You'll probably have to create a Transifex account. Try to use the same username as your Scratch account so that we can add you to the [credits page](https://turbowarp.org/credits.html). Enter your email, a new password, then Sign Up.
 - When asked for your name, enter your username as your name and surname instead of your real name. For "department" and "job title", select "localization" and "individual contributor".
 - On then next step, select "join an existing project".
 - Choose the language(s) you want to translate into.

The request will be accepted within a few days.

### Writing translations

Find your language on https://www.transifex.com/turbowarp/turbowarp/dashboard/ and click the Translate button.

Read https://docs.transifex.com/translation/translating-with-the-web-editor to learn how to use the Transifex translator.

Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and put into the website.

The most important resource to translate is `gui.json`. You should start with this one.
